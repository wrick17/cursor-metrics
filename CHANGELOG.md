# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- **Cursor Grok 4.6** (and Fast) in the first-party pricing catalog and pool classification.

### Changed
- Composer 2.5 Fast and Grok 4.5 Fast use official **customRates** ($3/$15 and $4/$12 per 1M) instead of same-rate-more-tokens.
- Pricing catalog sync parses the **Cursor Models** docs table (in addition to Other Models).
- GPT-5.6 Luna / Terra rates and Gemini 3.5 Flash `hidden` flag aligned with [cursor.com/docs/models-and-pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/models-and-pricing).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-20

### Changed
- Pool label **Auto** → **First-party models** (IT: *Modelli first-party*) across status bar, tooltip, dashboard, and help text — aligned with Cursor billing wording.
- Grok catalog display name → **Cursor Grok 4.5**.
- Dashboard usage chart always shows daily **tokens**; the usage filter (All / Included / On-Demand) moved to **Usage by model** and applies to chart, breakdown, and pricing usage columns.
- Pricing tab layout: full-width dashboard body, model names and badges kept on one line.

### Fixed
- Hide on-demand credit in status bar, tooltip, and dashboard when on-demand usage is disabled (no more `0,00 €/0,00 €` with state `limited`).
- First-party pool series and breakdown: classify Auto / Composer / Cursor Grok via pricing catalog `pool: "firstParty"` instead of only `model === "default"`.
- Billing-cycle cutoff: month overflow and local-timezone edge cases at end of month (`getBillingCycleCutoff` / `shiftUtcMonth`).
- Recommended pool usage target now uses a wall-clock denominator so it reaches 100% at reset.
- Dashboard daily budget bar normalizes `used/allowance` correctly.
- Pool usage series: uniform fallback shape when live pool % is > 0 but spend events are empty.
- Screenshot preview / tooltip HTML for html-validate (void elements, no inline styles, overlay focusability).
- **Request counts** for token-metered events: charts and tables count one call per event instead of surfacing API `requestsCosts` or polluted archive values.
- **Theoretical cost** for effort/thinking model slugs (e.g. `-fast`, `-thinking-high`) via expanded pricing alias resolution.
- Event archive deduplication after request normalization (fingerprint no longer depends on derived `requests` field; one-time store migration).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Daily budget reset countdown** in the dashboard pool card and status-bar tooltip — shows time until the daily allowance renews at midnight UTC (with local reset time).
- **Pin models** in the Pricing tab: star/unstar models to keep them at the top of the catalog; pin order and selection persist across dashboard sessions via extension global state.
- **Drag-and-drop reorder** for pinned pricing models (⋮⋮ handle on pinned rows).
- Screenshot generation scripts (`scripts/build-screenshot-previews.mjs`, `scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs`) and `bun run screenshots` for README/marketplace assets.

### Changed
- README screenshots updated to reflect the current dashboard (Usage, Pools, Pricing, Activity tabs) and status-bar tooltip.
- Italian pricing catalog labels and variant notes via `pricing-catalog-i18n.js`.

### Fixed
- Spacing above the expanded “Modes & pricing impact” panel in the Pricing tab.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- Dashboard **Pricing** tab with official per-component model rates sourced from `model-pricing.json`, including First-party vs API pool badges and provider filters.
- Model pricing catalog with variant modes (thinking, fast, max context), alias resolution, and per-model token cost calculator.
- Actual vs theoretical spend comparison and delta per model for the active dashboard range.
- Deep link from event detail and model breakdown into the matching pricing catalog row.
- Sticky dashboard main tabs: **Usage**, **Pools**, **Pricing**, and **Activity** (events / conversations).
- `src/model-pricing.ts` for catalog loading, variant-aware rate resolution, component cost estimation, and usage aggregation.
- `src/dashboard/dashboard-html.ts` to generate dashboard markup from the extension host.
- Cross-platform packaging and publish scripts (`scripts/package-extension.mjs`, `scripts/publish-extension.mjs`) using Bun instead of shell-only `vsce`/`ovsx` invocations.
- Split dashboard i18n into `en.js` / `it.js` locale bundles plus `pricing-catalog-i18n.js` for Italian variant labels and notes.
- Tests for model pricing catalog validation, alias/variant resolution, and theoretical cost estimation.

### Changed
- Decomposed monolithic `extension.ts`, `on-demand.ts`, `cursor-usage-fetch.ts`, and dashboard modules into smaller host and webview files for maintainability.
- Split dashboard CSS into layout, summary, events, and pricing stylesheets; refactored summary and tables into focused JS modules.
- Expanded README with Bun prerequisites, local VSIX build steps, and Open VSX / Visual Studio Marketplace publish workflow (including Windows PowerShell examples).
- Simplified `package.json` release scripts to delegate build, package, and publish to the new Bun scripts.

### Fixed
- Complete Italian localization for the pricing section UI, variant descriptions, and token component labels.
- Vertical spacing of the expanded “Modes & pricing impact” panel under each model row.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- Community fork rebranded as **Cursor Usage (Community)** for publication under publisher `fabervi`.
- Status bar, tooltip, and dashboard no longer show the legacy `used/limit` request counter when Cursor exposes pool usage (First-party Auto + API pools), matching current Cursor billing for Team, Enterprise, and modern personal plans.
- `minimalMode` now treats total pool exhaustion as the trigger on pool-based plans.
- Help text updated to describe the two-pool billing model instead of deprecated premium-request quotas.
- On-demand usage now uses `GetCurrentPeriodUsage` for accurate pooled/individual limits (integrated from cozminv fork).
- Stacked chart bars no longer use rounded corners on intermediate segments.

### Added
- `shouldShowPremiumRequestsQuota()` and `isIncludedQuotaExhausted()` helpers in `src/usage-display.ts`.
- Tests for pool-based vs legacy personal display rules.
- On-demand module (`src/on-demand.ts`) with team pool breakdown, spend-limit API parsing, and segmented progress bars.
- Dashboard UI preferences persistence (`range`, `usageFilter`, `metric`) across sessions.
- Totals row in Usage by Model table (dashboard and tooltip).

## [0.5.19] - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- Status bar, tooltip, and dashboard no longer show the legacy `used/limit` request counter when Cursor exposes pool usage (First-party Auto + API pools), matching current Cursor billing for Team, Enterprise, and modern personal plans.
- `minimalMode` now treats total pool exhaustion as the trigger on pool-based plans.
- Help text updated to describe the two-pool billing model instead of deprecated premium-request quotas.

### Added
- `shouldShowPremiumRequestsQuota()` and `isIncludedQuotaExhausted()` helpers in `src/usage-display.ts`.
- Tests for pool-based vs legacy personal display rules.

## [0.5.18] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Local SQLite archive for usage events (120-day lookback) with incremental sync from the Cursor API.
- Dashboard **Conversations** tab with optional title preview and message detail loaded from the Cursor state database.
- Italian/English language selector and USD/EUR currency display across dashboard, status bar, and tooltip.
- `cursorUsage.quotaAwareEventDisplay` to control whether dashboard events show included usage as requests and on-demand usage as spend.

### Changed
- Refactored Cursor API layer and dashboard frontend into smaller modules.
- Conversation aggregation and spend totals now share one implementation between host and webview.
- Dashboard webview receives usage events filtered to the active range/filter to reduce payload size.

### Fixed
- Dashboard events, chart spend, model breakdown spend, and CSV export now treat included premium-request usage as request quota usage by default instead of on-demand spend.
- Conversation message loading and DB reads surface errors instead of hanging on failure.
- Event deduplication fingerprint now covers full billing metadata to avoid silently dropping distinct events.

## [0.5.15] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Dashboard sections (Your Usage, Usage by Model, Events) are now collapsible. Section state is persisted across reloads.
- Dark mode support for the dashboard's filter dropdowns (Usage, Metric, sort selectors) so they match the rest of the themed UI in dark VS Code themes.

### Changed
- Replaced the unicode collapse glyphs with a 16×16 SVG chevron that uses `currentColor` and rotates 90° when a section is collapsed. Toggle hitbox enlarged from 14×14 to 20×20 for easier clicking.

## [0.5.12] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- Read Cursor auth tokens directly from `state.vscdb` without requiring a `sqlite3` CLI on PATH, native SQLite bindings, or platform-specific binaries.
- Support Cursor databases using WAL mode so freshly written auth values are visible.
- Avoid loading multi-GB Cursor databases into memory by traversing the SQLite table B-tree and reading only the auth rows needed.
- Harden dashboard CSV export against spreadsheet formula injection.
- Escape model names in trusted tooltip HTML and restrict trusted Markdown commands to known extension commands.
- Add request timeouts and a pagination cap for Cursor API fetches so refreshes cannot hang indefinitely.

## [0.5.11] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- Dashboard chart axis labels, gridlines, and legend text are now visible in light themes. VS Code webviews don't honor `prefers-color-scheme`, so light tokens are now applied via the `body.vscode-light` / `body.vscode-high-contrast-light` selectors that VS Code sets on the webview body.
- Chart tooltip uses themed surface, border, and foreground tokens instead of hardcoded dark colors so it remains readable in light themes.

## [0.5.10] - 2026-04-29

### Changed
- README now includes a screenshot of the in-editor dashboard alongside the existing tooltip screenshot, and lists the new `Cursor Usage: Open Dashboard` command.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- Dashboard now has a `Usage by Model` section between the chart and the events table, with sortable Model / Requests / Tokens / Spend columns. Each row reuses the chart's color tinting so it visually maps to the chart series.
- Chart tooltip is now a real HTML table with a header row, a colored model dot, and a per-row Spend column when viewing Tokens or Requests.

### Changed
- Constrained dashboard content to a 1000px max width for readability on wide monitors.
- Centered the chart legend.
- When the `Current Billing Cycle` range is selected, the chart's x-axis now extends through the last day of the cycle so the full span is visible even before later days have data.
- Y-axis tick labels drop the trailing `.0` (`60M` instead of `60.0M`).
- Events table rows are tinted with the model color and gain a 3px left accent border, replacing the previous inline dot.
- Refined the `MAX` badge to match Cursor's gradient text treatment (purple → pink → peach).

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- Dashboard events table now shows a per-event Spend column (sortable, in USD).
- Chart tooltip now appends each model's spend on that day alongside the selected metric value when viewing Tokens or Requests.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- VS Marketplace package now includes the `media/` directory so the dashboard webview's CSS, JavaScript, and bundled Chart.js load correctly. Previous 0.5.0 build shipped only `dist/` and `test/`, leaving the dashboard unstyled and non-interactive on VSCode.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- New `cursor-usage.openDashboard` command opens a full Cursor Usage dashboard in a VSCode editor tab.
- Dashboard renders Included-Request and On-Demand summary cards, a stacked bar chart of per-day usage, and a sortable Events table with Export CSV.
- Range tabs (Last 24 hours / Last 7 days / Last 30 days / Current Billing Cycle) match the `cursorUsage.usageDuration` setting labels.
- Chart filters for Usage (All / Included / On-Demand) and Metric (Spend / Tokens / Requests); per-event spend now derives from `chargedCents` so Spend works for solo and team accounts.
- Events table shows `MAX` mode badges and a colored model dot that matches the chart palette.

### Changed
- Status-bar click now opens the new dashboard instead of the inline message dialog.
- Tooltip "Open Dashboard" link and the no-data warning's "Open Dashboard" action now route to the new in-VSCode dashboard.
- Dashboard polling reuses the existing `cursorUsage.pollInterval` cadence; the dashboard auto-updates whenever the host fetches new data.
- Usage events now parse `requestsCosts` (fractional) and string timestamps from the Cursor API; popup table rounds requests to integers.
- Theme refresh: shadcn-style dark surface, soft pastel chart palette, rounded top corners on the topmost stack segment.

## [0.4.11] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Added `cursorUsage.excludeZeroTokenModels` to hide usage-by-model rows where token usage is zero.

### Changed
- Updated tooltip rendering to apply zero-token model filtering when the setting is enabled.
- Added tests covering filter behavior and configuration exposure.

## [0.4.10] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- Added `cursorUsage.modelBreakdownSortBy` to choose the usage-by-model table sort column (`Model`, `Requests`, `Tokens`, `Spend`).
- Added `cursorUsage.modelBreakdownSortOrder` to choose ascending or descending table order.

### Changed
- Updated usage-by-model aggregation to apply configured column/direction sorting, defaulting to `Tokens` descending.
- Added test coverage for new sort settings and ordering behavior.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-04-21

### Changed

### Changed
- Switched range selection from settings navigation to an in-tooltip QuickPick command.
- Persisted selected range in extension global state while still seeding from the legacy `cursorUsage.usageDuration` setting.
- Updated usage aggregation to support billing-cycle cutoffs derived from `resetsAt`.
- Expanded usage event and daily spend fetch windows from 30 to 31 days to cover longer billing cycles.
- Updated README to describe the new picker flow and legacy-setting migration behavior.
